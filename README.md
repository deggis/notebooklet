## Notebooklet

Notebooklet is a solution for managing personal notes. Notebooklet offers a
Twitter-like interface for adding notes and uses #hashtags for tagging them.

Notebooklet is a [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org) built on
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org). For short, Notebooklet is a
JavaScript application delivered straight from CouchDB, so there's no
extra application servers needed. Decision to use CouchDB was originally
based on the easiness of replication with it.

Development status: currently deploying & usage needs knowledge of
CouchApps, not all of the basic functionalities are ready.

Future plan: to complete and polish basic features for my own needs
(TODO: searching, attachments to enable image gallery-like use, styles)
and add some docs.
