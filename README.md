## Notebooklet

Notebooklet is a solution for managing personal notes. Notebooklet offers a
Twitter-like interface for adding notes and uses #hashtags for tagging them.

Notebooklet is a [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org) built on
[CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org). For short, Notebooklet is a
JavaScript application delivered straight from CouchDB, so there's no
extra application servers needed. Decision to use CouchDB was originally
based on the easiness of replication with it.

CouchDB is now automatically bundled with Ubuntu and installing CouchDB
is possible on Android phones, which make CouchDB an attractive choise
as DB backend for personal notes. Ideally, Notebooklet could be installed
in every workstation to enable local use and get benefits from CouchDB's
easy replication.

Development status: currently deploying & usage needs knowledge of
CouchApps, not all of the basic functionalities are ready.

Future plan: to complete and polish basic features for my own needs
(TODO: searching, attachments to enable image gallery-like use, styles)
and add some docs.
